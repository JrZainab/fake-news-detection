# fake-news-detection

This project detects fake news using machine learning. It uses the Fake and Real News Dataset from Kaggle. The models applied are Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. News text is preprocessed using TF-IDF, and the models are trained to classify articles as real or fake. Built with Python and Scikit-learn, the models achieve accuracy between 92% and 98%.
